# Resume Form Auto-Filler (Simulation)

A React-based demo that simulates the user experience of auto-filling job application forms by parsing a resume PDF. This project showcases handling file uploads, complex form state management, and creating a dynamic UI.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a career-changer learning frontend development, I noticed that manually filling out lengthy job application forms is a universal pain point. This project is my attempt to conceptualize and build a user-friendly solution for this problem.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Simulation)

*   **User Interaction:** The user uploads a PDF file, mimicking a real resume upload.
*   **Simulated Parsing:** Since PDF parsing in the browser is a complex backend challenge, this demo simulates the result using mock data.
*   **Auto-Fill:** Upon "upload," the form fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, etc.) are automatically populated with the mock data, demonstrating a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Plain CSS (or Tailwind CSS - if you used it)
*   **Deployment:** Netlify

## 🚧 Challenges & Learnings

*   **State Management:** Learned to efficiently manage multiple pieces of form state using React's `useState` hook.
*   **File Handling:** Gained experience with handling file input and the `onChange` events in a React environment.
*   Understood the complexity of true PDF parsing and made a strategic decision to simulate the core UX to demonstrate frontend capabilities.
